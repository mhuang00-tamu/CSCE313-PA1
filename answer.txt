File size (MB) vs Time taken (s)
1 MB - 0.00178413 s
10 MB - 0.0105545 s
50 MB - 0.0529766 s
100 MB - 0.0963888 s

Analysis:
The times taken seem to be increasing linearly with the file size. 

The main bottleneck is probably the time to communicate between the server and the client, since there are many chunks that need to be read and written. 
Additionally, experimenting with lowering chunk size (increasing # of chunks) using the -m flag increases time taken.
